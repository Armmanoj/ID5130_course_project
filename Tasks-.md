Tasks- 
1. Look at all the possible memory bugs
2. Clear obvious bugs and clean the formatting (chatgpt)
3. Figure out the parallel Bell-mann Ford (1 hr)


Debugging plan-
1. Make a copy of this folder, and a debugging plan, with print statements
2. Take outputs(file+visualizing) after pattern routing as well as maze routing
    print outputs-keep track of memory+others 
3. Plot the progress of simulated annealing
4. Time SA, bell-man ford.
5. Try a test case with a small number of large nets, as well as a large number of small-moderate nets

Required analytics-
. Number of vias, overflows, wirelength, percent improvement due to simulated annealing with graph of improvement vs time, maze routing total time

Report- 
Proper analysis of the timings- understand time complexity, speedup, what are the bottlenecks (memory + time), scaling

Deepak- Implement debugging plan, give estimates on the time complexity off bellmann-ford parallel version, as well as expected speedup
