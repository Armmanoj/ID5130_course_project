    M rows
    N columns
    C Capacity
    V cost of changing direction
    Gx, Gy are grid graph weights
    net_x stores x coordinates of corners in each path
    net_y stores y coordinates of corners in each path

    Funtions called:
    Task Scheduler -> This splits the entire net to be routed into different independent batches
    SSSP Algorithm -> 
    Pattern router -> This takes care of patterns in routing. It takes the parameters - M, N,
